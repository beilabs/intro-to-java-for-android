##Lesson 5
In this lesson, we take a look at exception handling within Java. You'll learn the difference between a checked and unchecked exception, as well as how we can use try / catch blocks to gracefully deal with errors that may arise during the execution of our code. We'll take a look at Eclipse's debugging features, and track down a logical error as well as an exception within a sample application. Finally, we'll examine the basic functionality and use of JUnit, and unit testing, and wrap up the lesson with a look at Eclipse's refactoring capabilities.

##Lesson 1
In this lesson, we'll get a quick overview of Android, and dive into setting up our environment. We'll install and configure the Android SDK, Java JDK, and the Eclipse IDE. We'll then configure Eclipse to support Android development, and download various components for our Android SDK. We'll spend a little bit of time looking at, and working with Eclipse itself, and build our first project - The Hello World Applicaton.
