##Lesson 1
In this lesson, we'll get a quick overview of Android, and dive into setting up our environment. We'll install and configure the Android SDK, Java JDK, and the Eclipse IDE. We'll then configure Eclipse to support Android development, and download various components for our Android SDK. We'll spend a little bit of time looking at, and working with Eclipse itself, and build our first project - The Hello World Applicaton.
